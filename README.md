#About Pycaret

PyCaret is an open source, low-code machine learning library in Python that aims to reduce the cycle time from hypothesis to insights. It is well suited for seasoned data scientists who want to increase the productivity of their ML experiments by using PyCaret in their workflows or for citizen data scientists and those new to data science with little or no background in coding. PyCaret allows you to go from preparing your data to deploying your model within seconds using your choice of notebook environment.

#About Dataset

A very popular kaggle dataset for beginners.In 15 April 1912, the Titanic had sunk on collision with an iceberg in its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. There were an estimated 2224 passengers on board, and more than 1500 died, making it one of the worst passenger ship disasters in history.

Our objective is to take a closer look at the people who survived this disaster and predict the likelihood of survival.

Data Set Column Descriptions
pclass: Passenger Class (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)
survived: Survival (0 = No; 1 = Yes)
name: Name
sex: Sex
age: Age
sibsp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
parch: Number of parents/children aboard
fare: Passenger fare (British pound)
embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
adult_male: A male 18 or older (0 = No, 1=Yes)
deck: Deck of the ship
who: man (18+), woman (18+), child (<18)
alive: Yes, no
embarked_town: Port of embarkation ( Cherbourg, Queenstown, Southampton)
class: Passenger class (1st; 2nd; 3rd)
alone: 1= alone, 0= not alone ( you have at least 1 sibling, spouse, parent or child on board)
age
Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5
sibsp
The dataset defines family relations in this way:
Sibling= brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
Spouse= husband, wife (mistresses and fiancÃ©s were ignored)
parch
The dataset defines family relations in this way:
Parent= mother, father
Child= daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
Some children traveled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
